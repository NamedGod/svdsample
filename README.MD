Use generate.py to generate two similar sets of matrices.

Then use svd.py to combine them into the same linear space.

Note that one set of matrices will be rotated in svd.py, thus the final result Q & W would prove how the SVD method preserves the information no matter how the vectors are transformed (as long as the transformation is canonical).
